# Klipper_Install_on_E2Pro_V2.4.s4_Board


Downloaded initial files from here: https://github.com/ChubbyBunny1/Ender-2-PRO-Klipper-HC32

Then I followed this guy's tutorial, essentially a text version of installing klipper: https://www.printsleo3d.com/klipperinstall

Vids from also him that I followed further:
